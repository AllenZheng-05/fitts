# Phase 2 progress

This log is the working memory for Phase 2. After any context compaction, re-read it, then
CLAUDE.md and the relevant SPEC-phase2 sections, before continuing.

## Current milestone and next step

- **Current:** P1 — events, shared reducer, IpcRunEngine, utility process, secrets bridge,
  file-based project store.
- **Next concrete step:** design `packages/schema/src/events.ts` (event union per §12.1) and a
  pure `reduce(state, event)`, then a stub agent that replays Scenario A as events.

## Done

| Milestone | Commit | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| Step 0: tag `phase1-prototype`, Phase 2 CLAUDE.md, progress log | 6bfad23 | done |
| P0: demo targets + vite plugin | see `git log --grep "P0:"` | demo/chat 25/25 planted issues reproduce (`pnpm check:demo-chat`); hartwell runs on :3000; the plugin stamps in dev only (unit tests, and a build has no stamps). Mirror repos are exported locally; creating and pushing them is NEEDS-ALLEN 3. |
| V1–V9 verification (`scripts/verify/`) | 290cf81 | V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V7 and V9 pass live. V6 passes offline (`pnpm verify:v6:echo`); the real-model run waits on `muse login` (NEEDS-ALLEN 1). V8: the flag is confirmed, and the live upload is deferred. |

## Deferred to Allen

See [NEEDS-ALLEN.md](NEEDS-ALLEN.md).

## Spend so far (USD)

About $0.06 of the $25 session cap. `.fitts-dev/spend.json` is the source of truth.

## Known issues

- `muse` in WSL isn't logged in. Fixes use the in-process Wonder fallback until it is.
- Windows paths passed into WSL as arguments lose their backslashes. Convert `C:` paths to
  `/mnt/c/...` in code (see `scripts/verify/v6-muse.ts`), not with `wsl wslpath`.
- A `| tail` after `pnpm lint` hides lint's exit code. Check lint on its own before
  committing.
